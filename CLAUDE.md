# Getting Started

Use Bun to install dependencies and run the project.

## Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

## Development

Run the frontend dev server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Run the Cloudflare Worker locally:

```bash
bun run worker:dev
```

Run both together (builds frontend then starts worker):

```bash
bun run dev:local
```

## Deploy

```bash
bun run deploy
```
