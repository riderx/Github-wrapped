## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/riderx/Github-wrapped.git
cd Github-wrapped
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Development

#### Option 1: Frontend and Backend Separately (Recommended for development)

Run the frontend (Vue.js) in one terminal:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

Run the backend (Cloudflare Worker) in another terminal:
```bash
npm run worker:dev
```

The worker API will be available at `http://localhost:8787`

#### Option 2: Test Full Deployment Locally (Recommended for testing)

To test the complete deployment setup locally using Wrangler (this simulates the production environment):

```bash
npm run dev:local
```

This command will:
1. Build the frontend (`npm run build`)
2. Start Wrangler development server with both the worker and static assets

The complete application (frontend + API) will be available at `http://localhost:8787`

**This is the recommended way to test before deploying to production, as it matches the actual deployment setup.**

### Usage

1. Open the app in your browser
2. Enter a GitHub username or organization name
3. (Optional) Click "Advanced Options" to:
   - Select a different year
   - Add a GitHub API token for private repository access
4. Click "Generate Wrapped" to see the results!

**Demo Mode:** Enter `demo` or `demouser` as the username to see a demonstration with mock data.

### GitHub API Token

To view private repository data, you'll need a GitHub Personal Access Token:

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate a new token with `repo` scope
3. Copy the token and paste it in the "API Token" field (in Advanced Options)

**Note:** The token is never stored and only used for API requests.

## Deployment

### Local Testing with Wrangler (Recommended Before Deployment)

Before deploying to production, test your changes locally with Wrangler to ensure everything works correctly:

```bash
npm run dev:local
```

This starts a local Cloudflare Workers environment at `http://localhost:8787` that serves both the frontend and API, exactly like production. Test all features including:
- Static asset serving (visit `http://localhost:8787/`)
- API endpoints (test with `http://localhost:8787/api/wrapped?username=demo`)
- SPA routing (navigate to different routes)

### Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions

This project includes automated deployment via GitHub Actions. Every push to the `main` branch automatically deploys everything as a **single Cloudflare Worker** that serves both the frontend and API.

#### How It Works

The Cloudflare Worker:
- Serves the Vue.js frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) from the `/dist` directory
- Handles API requests at `/api/wrapped`
- Uses Cloudflare Workers Sites to serve static assets
- Includes caching for optimal performance

#### Setup GitHub Actions Deployment

1. **Get your Cloudflare credentials:**
   - Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
   - Navigate to "My Profile" → "API Tokens"
   - Create a token with "Edit Cloudflare Workers" permissions
   - Note your Account ID (found in Workers & Pages overview)

2. **Add secrets to your GitHub repository:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API token
     - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare account ID

3. **Deploy:**
   - Push to `main` branch or manually trigger the workflow
   - The workflow will automatically:
     1. Build the frontend (`npm run build`)
     2. Deploy the worker with static assets
   - Check the Actions tab in GitHub for deployment status
   - Your app will be available at `https://github-wrapped.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`

### Manual Deployment

1. Install Wrangler CLI (if not already installed):
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
# or use the local version
npx wrangler --version
```

2. Login to Cloudflare:
```bash
wrangler login
```

3. Build and deploy using the convenience script:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

Or manually:
```bash
npm run build
wrangler deploy
```

The worker will automatically include the built frontend from the `dist/` folder and serve it alongside the API.

**Troubleshooting 404 Errors:**
- Ensure the frontend is built before deploying: `npm run build`
- Check that the `dist/` folder contains `index.html` and `assets/`
- Verify `wrangler.toml` has the correct `[assets]` configuration
- Test locally first with `npm run dev:local` to verify everything works

### Configuration Details

The deployment uses Cloudflare Workers Assets (modern approach) configured in `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[assets]
directory = "./dist"
binding = "ASSETS"
```

This configuration:
- Serves all static files from the `dist/` directory
- Provides an `ASSETS` binding to the worker for programmatic access
- Supports SPA routing (all non-API routes serve `index.html`)
- Includes automatic asset optimization and caching
